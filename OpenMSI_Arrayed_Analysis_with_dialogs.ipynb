    "Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables the mass analysis of thousands of spatially defined samples, and can be applied in the high-throughput screening of, for example, enzyme activity or compound libraries. Here we present the OpenMSI Arrayed Analaysis Tool, an iPython based software tool for the analysis of spatially defined samples with MSI.\n",
